1. The person microservice is a REST web service with a dedicated database. It is a best practise to use a dedicated database since it

2. Due to the data volume generated by mobile devices, the location events will be sent leveraging a Kafka queue. In order to ensure that the
correct kind of data is used in the message (integer for the person identifier and floats for latitude/longitude), it will combined with a grpc
endpoint. 
The kafka consumer will then read the message and store it in a location database.

3.This location database will be shared with the location microservice, which expose REST endpoints to retrieve locations.
Ideally, the database for this last service should be a read-only replica of the one used by the kafka consumer but this was not feasible with
the time and budget planned for this project.

4. The connection microservice provide REST endpoints dedicated to the calculation of connections between persons. It doesn't use any database.
Instead it uses the APIs provided by the person microservice and the location microservice to perform its job.
