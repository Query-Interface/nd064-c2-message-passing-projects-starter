grpc is used to send location of person with their mobile devices.

The location message contains 3 attributes:
  - the person identifier
  - the latitude of the position where the person is located
  - the longitude of the position where the person is located

How to test ?
  - use kubectl CLI to list the pods of the deployment *udaconnect-locations-kafka-api* and connect to one of the pods
    => kubectl get pods | grep udaconnect-locations-kafka-api
  - copuy the podname
  - use it in the following command: kubectl exec <podname> -- python location_client.py

You can then verify that a location have been added by accessing the following: http://localhost:30002/api/locations

----

message LocationMessage {
  int32 personId = 1;
  float latitude = 2;
  float longitude = 3;
}

service LocationService {
  rpc Create(LocationMessage) returns (LocationMessage);
}
